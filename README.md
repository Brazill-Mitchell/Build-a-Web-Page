# Build-a-Web-Page
Note: This page is only a practice project for applying new skills as I learn.

Add elements to a web page using simple controls. </br>
Use the options at the top of the page to choose the type of element you want to make. </br>
Pressing the Add button will add a new item below the most recent one. </br>
The font color & element type can be selected from the menus. </br>
Type element's content into the input field.</br>
The Style Menu changes the theme of the entire page with a single click. </br>
